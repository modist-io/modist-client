    .. important:: Everytime this method is called we are cycling the added handlers and
        thus their logger ids. This is required to implement the subsequent toggling of
        features that loguru handles. Because of this, the returned loguru handler ids
        are unreliable as they may be cycled by any other module which has imported this
        method.
        *In a perfect world* we should only ever configure the logger once and only once
        at the beginning of execution and toggle features using environment variables.
        Because of this, *it is recommended to avoid calling this method at all*. The
        necessary logic to configure loguru is already provided in the
        :meth:`~modist.log.get_logger` method and can be easily accessed via
        the ``instance`` property:

        >>> from modist.log import instance as log
        >>> log.info("This is a message")


    .. caution:: This method cannot handle both propagation and interception of logs as
        doing so would result in a recursive event where all logged propagated messages
        would be intercepted and re-propagated. In reality, you should
        **rarely if ever** be using ``intercept`` as you *almost* never want to override
        how Python's default logging works. Since so much external tooling depends on
        Python's nasty logging framework, intercepting logs is seen as a bad practice.
